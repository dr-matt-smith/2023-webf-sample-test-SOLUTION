Shopping List 

The provided tests are for a class which stores a shopping list of items.

The name of the list can be set and retrieved.

The list can be cleared, and items added.

If an empty name is submitted (for the list name itself, or an item to be added to list) then a string property containing the most recent error should be updated (which can be retrieved through a getter).
